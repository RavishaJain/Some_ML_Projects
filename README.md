# Some_ML_Projects
Here in this repo I have 3 different projects 
a. Car Price Prediction
b. Parkinson's Disease Detection
c. Sales Forecasting

**CAR PRICE PREDICTION**
The Car Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the price of cars based on various features.
Predicting car prices is a valuable application in the automotive industry, assisting buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.
This project utilizes a dataset containing information about different car models, including features like brand, mileage, engine power, fuel type, and more.

**Parkinson's Disease Detection**
The Parkinson's Disease Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model for early detection of Parkinson's disease based on relevant biomedical features.
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, and early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes.
This project utilizes a dataset containing clinical and biomedical information, including features like tremor amplitude, voice recordings, and demographic information.

**Sales Forecasting**
Sales Forecasting is a crucial task for businesses aiming to optimize inventory, manage resources efficiently, and make informed strategic decisions.
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for predicting future sales based on historical data and relevant business features.
The model aims to provide accurate forecasts that can aid in inventory planning, budgeting, and overall business strategy.
